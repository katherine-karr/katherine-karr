- 👋 Hi, I am [pizzaandchicken](https://github.com/pizzaandchicken).
- 👶 I was born in Buffalo, NY—home of the best pizza and chicken wings—but I currently live in Denver, Colorado.
- 👀 I am a writer, editor, and web developer.
- 🗺️ My coding journey began when I was in high school, writing HTML on Expage and GeoCities websites.
- 🧐 I became serious about coding in 2020 and started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 🌳 In March 2021, I completed the "Front End Web Development" and "Web Design" Tracks on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).
- 📫 You can reach me via [GitHub](https://github.com/pizzaandchicken).
