- 👋 Hello, I'm [pizzaandchicken](https://github.com/pizzaandchicken).
- 👶 I was born in Buffalo, NY—home of the best pizza🍕 and chicke wings🍗—but I currently live in Denver, Colorado—home of the best green chili🌶️.
- 💻 I'm a editor, writer, and coder.
- 🗺️ My coding journey began when I was in high school, writing HTML for Expage and GeoCities websites.
- 🧐 I became serious about coding in 2020 and began learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- 🌳 In March 2021, I completed the "Front End Web Development" and "Web Design" Tracks on [Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/).
